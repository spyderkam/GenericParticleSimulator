Looking at your system, you have a gravitational force and a time-varying repulsive force competing against each other. Let me analyze why  `G_scaling_factor = 0.75`  works better than  1.0.

Physical Interpretation

Your forces are:

**Gravity (attractive):**  
$$\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{grav}} = -G \cdot \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^2 + \epsilon_{\mathrm{grav}}^2} \hat{r}_{ij}$$

**Time-varying repulsion:**  
$$\mathbf{F}_{\zeta}(t) = |k_{\zeta}| \cdot \frac{\zeta(t)}{r_{ij}^2 + \epsilon_{\zeta}^2} \hat{r}_{ij}$$

where $\zeta(t) = 1 + A\sin(\omega_\zeta t)$ with $A = 1.0$.

Why G_scaling_factor = 0.75 works

When  `G_scaling_factor = 1.0`, you have $|k_\zeta| = G$. This means:

1.  **At $t=0$**: $\zeta(0) = 1$, so the repulsive force magnitude equals the gravitational force magnitude
2.  **At peak**: $\zeta_{\max} = 2$, so repulsion is twice as strong as gravity → net expansion
3.  **At trough**: $\zeta_{\min} = 0$, so gravity dominates completely → net contraction

The  **time-averaged**  repulsive force is:  
$$\langle \zeta(t) \rangle = 1 + A\langle\sin(\omega_\zeta t)\rangle = 1$$

However, the  **effective balance**  depends on the system's response to the oscillating force. With $A=1.0$, the oscillation swings from complete gravity dominance ($\zeta=0$) to strong repulsion dominance ($\zeta=2$).

The 0.75 Factor

By setting  `G_scaling_factor = 0.75`, you reduce $|k_\zeta| = 0.75G$. Now:

-   **At $t=0$**: Repulsion is 75% of gravity → slight net attraction
-   **At peak**: $\zeta_{\max} = 2$, so repulsion is $1.5G$ → moderate net expansion
-   **At trough**: $\zeta_{\min} = 0$, gravity fully dominates → net contraction

This creates a  **better balanced oscillation**  where:

-   The system doesn't expand too far during the repulsive phase
-   The contraction phase is strong enough to return the system
-   The net result after one period returns closer to the initial configuration

Why the ring expands at t=0.04 with G_scaling_factor=1

At  `t = 0.04`  (one full period), the phase returns to $\sin(\omega_\zeta t) = 0$, so $\zeta(t) = 1$. However, the  **particle velocities and positions**  acquired during the cycle matter.

With  `G_scaling_factor = 1.0`:

-   During the strong repulsive phase ($\zeta \approx 2$), particles gain significant outward momentum
-   During the weak attractive phase ($\zeta \approx 0$), they don't contract back enough
-   **Net effect**: A slight outward drift per cycle (secular expansion)

With  `G_scaling_factor = 0.75`:

-   The weaker repulsion prevents excessive outward velocities
-   The asymmetry between expansion and contraction is reduced
-   **Net effect**: Near-perfect return to initial state after one period

This is a  **resonance tuning problem**  — you're empirically finding the coupling strength that creates stable breathing oscillations rather than secular drift.
